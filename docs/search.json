    "text": "I’m Brandon Choi, a second-generation Korean Canadian from Coquitlam, British Columbia, and I moved to Alberta for university. Over the past few years, I’ve explored a range of areas in finance, but as I get closer to finishing my degree, I’ve become increasingly focused on trading as a long-term career path. Moving to Alberta deepened my interest in energy markets, and my goal is to work on an energy trading or risk desk where I can combine market fundamentals, data, and disciplined decision-making. At the same time, I see these skills as transferable and I’m excited to apply them across other commodities and markets as well.\nMy most recent co-op has been in the utilities industry, where I worked as a Junior Analyst at 8760. In this role, I built and maintained financial models that pull data from multiple utility-provider portals, improved internal and client reporting accuracy, and supported ad hoc analysis. A big part of the work is translating market movement into clear insights through visuals and concise write-ups, helping clients understand cost drivers and risk exposure in Alberta’s power and natural gas markets.\nStudent leadership has been a major part of my university experience. I’m the Co-President of the Business Finance Association, where I help lead the club’s direction and a 17-person executive team. We run networking events, speaker sessions, and case-based programming to help students learn faster, meet mentors, and feel more confident pursuing finance. The most meaningful part for me is building resources and opportunities that make finance more accessible for students who are still figuring out their path. I’ve also taken on leadership roles focused on learning and professional development across campus. As VP Academic Affairs with the Interdisciplinary Consulting Association and the Business Exchange Association, I’ve helped design case competitions and academic programming, including writing a case for the Global Hydrogen Case Competition and supporting events connected to industry initiatives like the Canadian Hydrogen Convention. These experiences pushed me to communicate more clearly, structure better problems, and create environments where people can learn by doing.\nThrough coursework and work experience, I’ve built technical and soft skills, but the most important thing I’ve learned is how to think critically and act with intention. That is what draws me to trading. It rewards structured thinking, data-driven insight, strong heuristics, and the ability to test and refine a thesis under pressure. I like that it is competitive and high accountability, and I’m motivated by the challenge of improving my process in a zero-sum environment.\nOutside of finance, I’m into trying new food spots, reading fantasy, following the NBA, snowboarding, and playing video games."
